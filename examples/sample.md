# Presentor
## Turn Text Into Beautiful Presentations

---

# The Problem

- Creating presentations takes too long
- Design tools are overkill for simple decks
- You already have the content — you just need slides
- What if you could write text and get a deck?

---

# How It Works

1. Write your content in a simple text format
2. Run `presentor input.md -f html`
3. Get a beautiful, interactive presentation
4. Share it, present it, export it

> "The best presentation tool is the one that gets out of your way."
